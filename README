I have followed IGN faithfully for the past 5 years, keeping up with mostly game reviews, movie reviews and the occasional Babe of the Day =P.
I am a 4th year EECS major at UC Berkeley, and I actually was looking to intern at IGN in the past because I've been a gamer ever since I was 4 years old with my first game being Space Invaders. I would love to do work on future IGN projects all the while also providing for the userbase. I would love nothing more than to improve on my coding ability and to work with IGN to fulfill my gaming needs and desires. Working at IGN would be like unlocking a new world or gaining new levels in my life. Life is a game, we need to keep playing it.
